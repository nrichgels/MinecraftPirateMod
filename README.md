For Senior Sem

Minecraft Version:
Minecraft Forge Version: 1.7.10-10.13.2.1291

Unfortuantely, this mod wasn't designed with easy installation.
To use this repo, put in the MinecraftForge/src/main/java directory and rename the directory to "nathan".

Unfortunately, this repository doesn't include the texture.  You can download it here: http://imgur.com/Ye4GN7Z
Within MinecraftForge\src\main\resources\assets\ you will need to add the follwowing three directories and set the texture in there: pirates\textures\entity
